# rawsocket-to-websocket
These two PHP scripts would help transfer messages from raw socket clients to web socket clients (through 2 socket servers).

# Usage situation
You have some information within your application/software that you want to publish to your audiences on websites. The best case is that your application can start a web-socket connection.  
However, most of application does not support this protocol but raw-socket. That's why this bridge exists to solve.

```
   RAW-SOCKET SERVER  
(as a web-socket client) -------> WEB-SOCKET SERVER -------> WEB-SOCKET CLIENT(s)  
        ^  
        |  
        |  
  RAW-SOCKET CLIENT(s)
```

# How to start
Start servers in developing mode with terminal to see debug messages (if needed):
```
php -q rawsocket.php  
php -q websocket.php
```

Start servers in background with defaul nohup.out at current directory:
```
nohup php -q rawsocket.php &  
nohup php -q websocket.php &
```

Start servers in background without output (nohup.out):
```
nohup php -q rawsocket.php >/dev/null 2>&1 &  
nohup php -q websocket.php >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

# Default address & port
The raw-socket server starts at `0.0.0.0` with port `9000`. This would accept all connections to this server. If you want to limit to localhost to connect (your clients run on the same machine), you should change host to `127.0.0.1`.
The web-socket server starts at `0.0.0.0` with port `9001`. This would accept all connections to this server. If you want to limit to localhost to connect (your clients run on the same machine), you should change host to `127.0.0.1`.

You can change these ports to any number you want. However, they should be larger than `5000`; if not, you need more granted permission to start these servers.
